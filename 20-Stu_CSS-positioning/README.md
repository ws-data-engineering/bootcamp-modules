# üèóÔ∏è Implement Absolute and Relative Positioning to Change Layout

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the CSS position property to change the layout of my page.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when `box 2` is positioned in the middle of `square 1` using relative positioning.

* It's done when `box 2` is positioned outside of the upper-right corner of `square 2` using absolute positioning.

* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.  

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## üí° Hints

How does the CSS `position` property change the document's normal flow? 

Positioning allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the `z-index` property? 

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element on an HTML webpage.

/* Keyword value */
z-index: auto;

/* <integer> values */
z-index: 0;
z-index: 3;
z-index: 289;
z-index: -1; /* Negative values to lower the priority */

/* Global values */
z-index: inherit;
z-index: initial;
z-index: revert;
z-index: revert-layer;
z-index: unset;
